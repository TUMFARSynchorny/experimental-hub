    Implements hub.filter_api_interface.FilterAPIInterface

    FilterSubprocessAPI is run on a subprocess and does not have direct access to data
    / functionality filters may require.  To access that data / functionality, it sends
    commands to a hub.filter_subprocess_receiver.FilterSubprocessReceiver on the
    main process.  Sending the commands is  donne using `_relay_command`, which is
    intended to be the `_send_command` function in
    hub.connection_runner.ConnectionRunner.
