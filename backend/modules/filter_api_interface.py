class FilterAPIInterface(ABC):
    """Abstract interface filter APIs.

    The filter API is intended to provide filters with access to data and functionality
    that may not be available on the same process, in case subprocesses are enabled.
    For this purpose, FilterAPIInterface provides an interface independent of the
    process the filter and data/function a filter may want to access is on.

    Notes
    -----
    Do not instantiate directly, use subclasses / implementations of
    `FilterAPIInterface` instead.

    When a filter requires additional data or access to functionality outside of the
    subprocesses part of the hub, the filter API should be extended.  In theory, the API
    could get access to all parts of the program, e.g. by adding access to the hub to
    modules.filter_api.FilterAPI.

    When adding a function to the filter API, it should be defined in
    modules.filter_api_interface.FilterAPIInterface and implemented in
    modules.filter_api.FilterAPI as well as
    modules.filter_subprocess_api.FilterSubprocessAPI.
