    Instantiate new hub.experimenter.Experimenter, handle offer using
    hub.connection.connection_factory and set connection for the Experimenter.

    This sequence must be donne for all experimenters.  Instantiating an Experimenter
    directly will likely lead to problems, since it won't have a Connection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    offer : aiortc.RTCSessionDescription
        WebRTC offer for building the connection to the client.
    experimenter_id : str
        Unique identifier for Experimenter.
    hub : modules.hub.Hub
        Hub the Experimenter will be part of.  Used for api calls.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple with aiortc.RTCSessionDescription, hub.experimenter.Experimenter
        WebRTC answer that should be sent back to the client and Experimenter
        representing the client.
