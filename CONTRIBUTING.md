# Contributing

To contribute create a new branch in which changes are made. Branches should be named using the following convetion:

`[<frontend/backend>-]<initals>-<topic>`

Branch names are in lowercase. If the change regards the frontend or backend start the name with `frontend` or `backend` respectively. If it's a general change this part is omitted. The topic can be multiple words which should be sperated by hyphens (`-`). 

When the work on the branch is done, create a pull request to merge the branch into `main`. After merging, branches are deleted.

## Convetions
The following conventions should be followed when working on experimental-hub.

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Provide a more detailed description in the next line, if the first line is not descriptive enough
